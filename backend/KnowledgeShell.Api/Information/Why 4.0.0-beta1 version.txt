There's a problem using latest version of https://github.com/json-api-dotnet/JsonApiDotNetCore
See issue and posible solution: https://github.com/json-api-dotnet/JsonApiDotNetCore/issues/726
However it's easier just to deprecate version to 2.1 and everything works fine!

After some work I realized that version 2.1 doesn't patch relations.. 
(in my case doesn't patch parent for model Frame)
I've tried to use a lot of versions for example 2.3;2.4;2.5... and higher but I've got an error with
System.Interactive.Async
possible solutions:
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/1818
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/8541
but it didn't work out, so I've tried 2.2.5 and it works! (hope not only for today :D)

After a bit more work I realized that 2.2.5 didn't support nested relations (comments.author.info)
so I tried a lot of versions and come to the conclusion that I should try current version and after some
refactoring it works! (you have to manually install all dependencies... build current version and add as dependency in your project)

Filters don't work in 4.0.0-alpha so after releasing new 4.0.0-beta1 everything is fine
see: https://github.com/json-api-dotnet/JsonApiDotNetCore/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta1

^^ Not important anymore since 4.0.* is official.

There's some promlem with swagger in VS 2019, need to close the solution and delete .vs folder then open it again and everyting is okay
